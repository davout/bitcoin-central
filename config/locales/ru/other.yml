    <p>
      Transferring bitcoins is possible to a bitcoin central account or to a bitcoin address,
      funds will be sent either through the bitcoin network or inside bitcoin central
      depending on whether the address is owned by a bitcoin central user, transfers
      to accounts will always happen inside bitcoin central.
    </p>
    <p>
      Transferring any currency to a bitcoin central account is free.
    </p>
    <p>
      Transferring funds to e-mail addresses will simply deduct the funds from your account
      and notify the payee that they are waiting for him on bitcoin central. If the payee
      does not collect the funds after a certain amount of time they will be returned to you.
      <strong>This functionality is not active yet.</strong>
